# DramaBot
DramaBot is a dim-witted chatbot trained on the [Cornell Movie-Dialogues corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) - hence its flair for drama.
Two different model architectures have been first implemented and then evaluated: a seq2seq RNN (see [Sutskever et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215)) and a Transformer (see [Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).
